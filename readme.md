### Technical Review  

Create a blog where a user may register, sign in, view all blog entries, post new / edit existing / delete existing blog entry, and log out.

#### Task

Using the included assets 'from the client' (assets_from_client.zip), please re-create the screens detailed in the mockup. Build out the user functionality (registration, login, logout) utilizing the language of your choice (PHP / Laravel would be ideal). Please try to levrage the base level Vue functionality in `login.js` and templating in `index.html`. If you are not comfortable using Vue, you may use another language in its place.

Make sure to review all of the files to famaliarize yourself with the project. When / if you see an opportunity to clean up existing functionality please do so, and leave a comment detailing your changes.
